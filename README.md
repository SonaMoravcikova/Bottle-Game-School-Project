# School Project: Bottle Game

This repository contains a Python project developed as part of my school assignment, focusing on the implementation of a bottle filling game. The project is divided into three assignments, each allowing me to practice different programming concepts.

### Assignment 1
In the first assignment, I practiced variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, sequences (strings, lists, tuples), and functions. My task was to develop a Python program that allows several users to fill a single bottle, trying to be the first one to fill it exactly. The game was to end either when one of the players fills the bottle (reaching its capacity), or when all players have lost (because their plays all exceeded the capacity of the bottle).

### Assignment 2
The second assignment involved practicing dictionaries, comprehensions, and functions implementing more complex algorithms. I developed a Python program that allows a single user to play a game where they must fill several bottles, each with the same "liquid" symbol by transfering "liquid" between bottles step by step. It's only allowed to add "liquid" to a given bottle that has the same symbol as its top.

### Assignment 3
In the third assignment, I practiced file input/output and exceptions. My task was to add a new functionality to the game: the ability to stop the game at any time and store the relevant information to restart playing from the exact point where it was interrupted.

### Repository Structure
The repository is structured into three folders:
- **Assignment1:** Contains the code for the first assignment.
- **Assignment2:** Contains the code for the second assignment.
- **Assignment3:** Contains the code for the third assignment, including `gameFunctions.py` and example files (`oldGame` and `newGame`) showcasing the new functionality added to the game.

The code for each assignment demonstrates my application of various programming concepts learned during the course.

Feel free to explore each assignment folder for more details on the implementation and functionality.
